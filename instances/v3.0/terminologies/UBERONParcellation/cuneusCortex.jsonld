  "description": "Component of the occipital lobe. The rostral boundary was the first coronal slice above the calcarine sulcus where the cuneus cortex becomes visible whereas the caudal boundary was the last slice where the calcarine sulcus was visualized. The medial boundary was the most medial portion of the occipital and parietal cortices. The superio-lateral boundary was the parieto-occipital fissure whereas the inferolateral boundary was the pericalcarine cortex (Christine Fennema-Notestine).
