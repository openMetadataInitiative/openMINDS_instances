  "description": "The renal plexus is formed by filaments from the celiac plexus, the aorticorenal ganglion, and the aortic plexus. It is joined also by the least splanchnic nerve. The nerves from these sources, fifteen or twenty in number, have a few ganglia developed upon them. They accompany the branches of the renal artery into the kidney; some filaments are distributed to the spermatic plexus and, on the right side, to the inferior vena cava.
