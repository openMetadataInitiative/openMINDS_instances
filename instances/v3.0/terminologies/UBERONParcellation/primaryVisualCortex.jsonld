  "description": "A subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined occipital region of cerebral cortex in the human. Defined by the band of Gennari, which gives it the name striate (furrowed) area, it occupies the banks of the calcarine sulcus which are located in the cuneus and the lingual gyrus of the occipital lobe. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded by the area 18 of Brodmann (human) which surrounds it ( Brodmann-1909 ). In the mouse ( Paxinos-2001 ) and the rat ( Swanson-1998 ) it is located on the dorsolateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere.
