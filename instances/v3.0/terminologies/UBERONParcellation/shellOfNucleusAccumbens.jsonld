  "description": "Crescent shaped outer zone of the nucleus accumbens, defined by a combination of chemoarchitecture and afferent and efferent connections. The shell is distinguished from the more centrally located core through the notable reduction in staining for the calcium-binding protein calbindin D28K, which is dense in the core and virtually absent in the shell.
