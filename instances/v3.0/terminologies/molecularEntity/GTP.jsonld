  "definition": "Guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) is a purine nucleoside triphosphate. [sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate)]",
  "description": "GTP is one of the building blocks needed for the synthesis of RNA during the transcription process. It also has a role as an activator of substrates in metabolic reactions and as a source of energy for protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis. GTP is essential to signal transduction, in particular with G-proteins, in second-messenger mechanisms where it is converted to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) through the action of GTPases.
