  "definition": "A spatial encoding method in which position in three dimensions is represented using frequency encoding along one axis and phase encoding along two orthogonal axes.",
  "description": "In 3D frequency x phase x phase MRI imaging, spatial localization is achieved using frequency encoding, phase encoding, and a second phase encoding step instead of slice selection. Unlike 2D imaging, where individual slices are excited separately, 3D MRI excites the entire imaging volume at once. Frequency encoding is applied along one axis (typically the x-axis), while phase encoding is applied along the second (usually the y-axis). To resolve the third dimension, an additional phase encoding step is applied along the slice-select direction (typically the z-axis), replacing traditional slice selection. This results in a fully sampled 3D dataset, which can be reconstructed into thin slices or reformatted in multiple planes, providing higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and improved spatial resolution compared to 2D imaging.",
