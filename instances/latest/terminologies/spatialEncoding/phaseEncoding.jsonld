  "definition": "A spatial encoding method in which position along a single dimension is represented by controlled phase shifts of the signal.",
  "description": "In one-dimensional phase encoding, spatial position is encoded through accumulated phase differences. A preparatory gradient or modulation step introduces position-dependent phase offsets. These phase shifts are sampled over repeated measurements. Spatial information is recovered through Fourier or phase-sensitive reconstruction. This method is commonly used when frequency-based encoding is impractical or insufficient.",
