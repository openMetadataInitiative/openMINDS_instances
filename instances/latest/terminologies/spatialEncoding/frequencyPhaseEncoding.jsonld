  "definition": "A spatial encoding method in which position in two dimensions is represented using frequency encoding along one axis and phase encoding along a second axis.",
  "description": "In two-dimensional frequency–phase encoding, one spatial direction is mapped to signal frequency and the other to signal phase. A readout gradient establishes frequency encoding, while stepped gradients impose phase encoding. Multiple acquisitions are combined to sample the two-dimensional encoding space. Reconstruction converts frequency and phase information into planar spatial coordinates. This approach is widely used in two-dimensional imaging and mapping applications.",
