  "definition": "A spatial encoding method in which position in three dimensions is represented using frequency encoding along one axis and phase encoding along two orthogonal axes.",
  "description": "In three-dimensional frequency-phase-phase encoding, spatial information is distributed across one frequency-encoded and two phase-encoded dimensions. A readout gradient provides frequency discrimination along one axis. Two independent phase-encoding steps encode the remaining spatial directions. Repeated acquisitions sample the three-dimensional encoding space. Reconstruction produces volumetric spatial representations from the combined frequency and phase data.",
