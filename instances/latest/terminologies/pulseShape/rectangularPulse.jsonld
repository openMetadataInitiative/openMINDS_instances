  "definition": "A pulse with constant amplitude over its duration and abrupt onset and offset transitions.",
  "description": "A rectangular pulse maintains a uniform amplitude for a defined time interval. The rise and fall times are ideally instantaneous. Its frequency spectrum follows a sinc distribution. This shape is widely used in stimulation and RF excitation as a hard pulse. It represents the simplest temporal pulse form.",
