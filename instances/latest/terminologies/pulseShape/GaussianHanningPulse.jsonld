  "definition": "A composite pulse formed by applying a Hanning window to a Gaussian pulse envelope.",
  "description": "A Gaussian-Hanning pulse combines a Gaussian envelope with a Hanning apodization window. The additional windowing further smooths temporal boundaries. This reduces spectral leakage beyond that of a simple Gaussian pulse. The pulse maintains symmetry about its center. It is used in applications requiring controlled spectral characteristics.",
