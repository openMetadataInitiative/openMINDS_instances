  "definition": "A composite pulse formed by modulating a sinc pulse with a Gaussian envelope.",
  "description": "A sinc-Gaussian pulse multiplies a sinc waveform by a Gaussian window. The Gaussian envelope reduces sidelobes in the frequency domain. This modification improves spectral selectivity compared to a truncated sinc pulse. The resulting waveform retains the central lobe characteristics of the sinc function. It is commonly used where reduced spectral leakage is required.",
