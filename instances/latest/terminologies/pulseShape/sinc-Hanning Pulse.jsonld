  "definition": "A composite pulse formed by modulating a sinc pulse with a Hanning window.",
  "description": "A sinc-Hanning pulse applies a Hanning window to a sinc waveform. The window smooths the pulse edges and suppresses spectral sidelobes. This reduces ringing artifacts compared to a simple truncated sinc. The central excitation profile remains governed by the sinc component. The pulse is used in applications requiring improved spectral control.",
