  "definition": "D-AP5 is the D-isomer of AP5, a chemical compound that is a selective NMDA receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits the ligand (glutamate) binding site of NMDA receptors. [adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP5)]",
  "description": "The active isomer of AP5 is considered to be the D configuration. AP5 is sometimes used in conjunction with the calcium chelator BAPTA to determine whether NMDARs are required for a particular cellular process. AP5 has also been used to study NMDAR-dependent LTP in the mammalian hippocampus. [adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP5)]",
