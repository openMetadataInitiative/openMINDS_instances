  "description": "The area of the temporal lobe concerned with hearing. The transverse temporal gyri (also called Heschl's gyri or Heschl's convolutions) are found in the area of primary auditory cortex in the superior temporal gyrus of the human brain, occupying Brodmann areas 41 and 42. It is the first cortical structure to process incoming auditory information. Anatomically, the transverse temporal gyri are distinct in that they run mediolaterally (towards the center of the brain) rather than dorsiventrally (front to back) as all other temporal lobe gyri run. The Heschl's gyri are named after Richard L. Heschl. [definition of the [UBERON ontology term](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003939)]",
