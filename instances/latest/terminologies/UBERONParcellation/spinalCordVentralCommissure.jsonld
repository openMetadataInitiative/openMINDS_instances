  "description": "The band of nerve fibers which cross the midline of the spinal cord ventral to the central canal and posterior grey commissure. The anterior (or ventral) white commissure, also known as the alba anterior medullae spinalis, is a bundle of nerve fibers which cross the midline of the spinal cord just anterior to the gray commissure. A N4 fibers and C fibers carrying pain sensation in the spinothalamic tract contribute to this commissure, as do fibers of the anterior corticospinal tract, which carry motor signals from the primary motor cortex.
