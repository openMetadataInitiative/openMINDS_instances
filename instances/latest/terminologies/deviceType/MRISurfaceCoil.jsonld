    "definition": "Type of radiofrequency coil optimized for localized signal reception from tissues near the coil surface, providing high sensitivity over a small field of view.",
    "description": "Surface coils are small radiofrequency coils placed directly adjacent to the region of interest to capture strong signals from nearby tissues with high spatial resolution. Their sensitivity decreases rapidly with distance, making them ideal for imaging superficial structures such as the spine, joints, or breast. Surface coils are typically receive-only and operate in combination with a separate transmit coil, often the body coil. They can also serve as building blocks in multicoil or phased-array configurations, extending coverage while maintaining local sensitivity.",
