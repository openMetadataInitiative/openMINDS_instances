    "definition": "Type of radiofrequency coil composed of multiple coordinated elements optimized for transmit and/or receive operation over an extended field of view; phased-array coils are a specialized subclass focused on parallel signal reception.",
    "description": "Multicoil arrays consist of several individual RF elements that work together to improve signal quality, coverage, and control of the B₁ field. Depending on their configuration, they may operate as transmit, receive, or transmit–receive systems, enabling techniques such as RF shimming, parallel transmission, and parallel imaging. These arrays can be designed with volume-type geometries that enclose the anatomy or surface-type arrangements that conform to the body’s contour. Phased-array coils represent a subset of multicoil arrays specialized for independent receive channels used in parallel acquisition.",
