    "definition": "Type of radiofrequency coil optimized for uniform transmit and/or receive coverage across a defined enclosed volume of anatomy.",
    "description": "Volume coils are radiofrequency coils that fully or partially enclose the anatomy to produce a homogeneous B‚ÇÅ field within a specified region, such as the head, torso, or extremities. They are used for both transmission and reception of MR signals and are commonly built in birdcage or quadrature configurations. Volume coils provide uniform excitation and reception, making them suitable for general-purpose imaging or as transmit coils in combination with local receive arrays. Their subtypes include body, head, and extremity coils, which differ mainly by size and anatomical coverage.",
