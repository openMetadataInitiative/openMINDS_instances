  "definition": "A parallel MRI reconstruction technique that accelerates imaging by undersampling k-space and reconstructing missing data using calibration-derived interpolation kernels in k-space.",
  "description": "A generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition, short GRAPPA, acquires undersampled k-space data along with additional autocalibration lines. The method determines reconstruction weights directly from acquired calibration data without requiring explicit coil sensitivity maps. Missing k-space lines are synthesized by linear combinations of neighboring acquired data across multiple coils. Reconstruction occurs in k-space prior to final Fourier transformation. The technique is robust to coil sensitivity estimation errors and widely implemented in clinical MRI systems.",
