  "definition": "A water–fat separation technique that acquires images at different echo times to mathematically decompose water and fat signals based on their phase differences.",
  "description": "The Dixon water–fat separation technique exploits the phase shift between water and fat signals that occurs at specific echo times due to their chemical shift difference. Images are acquired at in-phase and out-of-phase echo times, allowing computational separation of water and fat components. Multi-echo implementations improve robustness by modeling field inhomogeneities and signal complexity. The technique provides uniform fat suppression even in regions with magnetic field variation. Modern implementations form the basis of many contemporary clinical fat–water imaging protocols.",
