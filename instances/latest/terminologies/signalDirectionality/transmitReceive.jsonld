  "definition": "A signal directionality mode in which a device both emits and detects signals within the same system or operational context.",
  "description": "In signal-transceiving mode, the device integrates transmitting and receiving functions. It alternates between emission and detection or performs both simultaneously depending on system design. Switching and isolation mechanisms are used to prevent self-interference. Operational timing is coordinated to manage bidirectional signal flow. This mode is common in imaging, communication, and active sensing technologies.",
