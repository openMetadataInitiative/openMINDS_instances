  "description": "A gzip (.gz) file is a compressed archive using the GNU zip algorithm. Unlike the ZIP format, which packages multiple files along with directory structure, gzip typically compresses a single file or data stream. It uses the DEFLATE compression method for efficient lossless compression and is commonly combined with tar (as .tar.gz or .tgz) when multiple files need compression.",
