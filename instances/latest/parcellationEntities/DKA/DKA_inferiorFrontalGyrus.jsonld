  "definition": "First, the whole of the inferior frontal gyrus was labelled volumetrically, and then was subdivided on the surface. The rostral boundary was the rostral extent of the inferior frontal sulcus, and the caudal boundary was the precentral gyrus. The medial and lateral boundaries were the lateral bank of the inferior frontal sulcus and the medial bank of the lateral orbital sulcus and/or the circular insular sulcus, respectively.
