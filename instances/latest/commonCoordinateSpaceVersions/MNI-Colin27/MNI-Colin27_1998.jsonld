  "description": "The 'MNI Colin 27 Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model' is a stereotaxic average of T1-, T2- and PD-weighted MRI scans of the same individual (27, 12 and 12 scans, respectively).It was created at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). The MRI scans were automatically registered to a common stereotaxic space using MRITOTAL (an automated volumetric registration procedure), resampled and intensity averaged.",

  "versionInnovation": "This is the original version of the common coordinate space. The T1 average image was created in a two step process. First, each of the 27 T1-weighted scans were registered to stereotaxic space using the MRITOTAL procedure and resampled onto a 1 mm grid in stereotaxic space. All 27 scans were averaged together to create an initial average. This average volume was used as a target for the second phase of registration where each original T1-weighted MRI was re-registered in stereotaxic space. This procedure has the advantage of removing the small variance in intra-subject mapping in stereotaxic space associated with the use of a multi-subject average. The T2 and proton density (PD) average images were performed similarly and were also of higher quality than single scans, but the improvement was not as dramatic as that of the T1 volumes."
