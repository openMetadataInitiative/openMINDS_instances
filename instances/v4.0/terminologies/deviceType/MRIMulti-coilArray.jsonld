  "definition": "Type of radiofrequency coil composed of multiple coordinated elements optimized for transmit and/or receive operation over an extended field of view; phased-array coils are a specialized subclass focused on parallel signal reception.",
  "description": "Multi-coil arrays consist of several individual RF elements that work together to improve signal quality, coverage, and control of the B₁ field. Depending on their configuration, they may operate as transmit, receive, or transmit-receive systems, enabling techniques such as RF shimming, parallel transmission, and parallel imaging. These arrays can be designed with volume-type geometries that enclose the anatomy or surface-type arrangements that conform to the body's contour. Phased-array coils represent a subset of multi-coil arrays specialized for independent receive channels used in parallel acquisition.",
