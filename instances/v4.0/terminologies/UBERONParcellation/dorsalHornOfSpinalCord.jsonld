  "description": "The pronounced, dorsolaterally oriented ridge of grey matter in each lateral half of the spinal cord. the dorsal (more towards the back) grey matter of the spinal cord. It receives several types of sensory information from the body, including light touch, proprioception, and vibration. This information is sent from receptors of the skin, bones, and joints through sensory neurons whose cell bodies lie in the dorsal root ganglion. The dorsal region of the mature spinal cord contains neurons that process and relay sensory input. [definition of the [UBERON ontology term](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002256)]",
