  "definition": "An elemental molecule consisting of two trivalently-bonded nitrogen atoms. [adapted from ChEBI (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:17997)]",
  "description": "At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element nitrogen bond to form N2, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant uncombined element in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth. [adapted from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen)]",
