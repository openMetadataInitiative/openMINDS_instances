  "definition": "Gluconic acid is an organic compound with molecular formula C6H12O7 and condensed structural formula HOCH2(CHOH)4CO2H. [adapted from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconic_acid)]",
  "description": "A white solid, it is forms the gluconate anion in neutral aqueous solution. The salts of gluconic acid are known as 'gluconates'. Gluconic acid, gluconate salts, and gluconate esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose. Some drugs are injected in the form of gluconates.
