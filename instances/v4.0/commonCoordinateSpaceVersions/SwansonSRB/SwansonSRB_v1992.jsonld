  "description": "The coordinate space of Swanson\u2019s \u2018Brain Maps: Structure of the Rat Brain\u2019 uses Bregma as its origin. The coordinates stated under \u2018axesOrigin\u2019 are the coordinates of the origin in the physical coordinate system of the rat brain. The coordinates, AP = 8.11 mm, DV = 12 mm and ML = 0 mm, were obtained by combining the information provided in the physical book and the pdf version of the 3rd edition of Brain Maps: (1) \"In the physical coordinate system, the z axis begins (= 0) at the rostral tip of the olfactory bulb, the y axis begins along an imaginary line that corresponds approximately to a surface that the extracted brain is lying upon, and the x axis begins at the midline.\" (quoted from chapter [\u2018B. Coordinate Systems: Stereotaxic Surgery and Databases\u2019 of the 3rd edition of Brain Maps (pdf version from Swanson\u2019s homepage)](http://larrywswanson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-Atlas-prep-BrainMaps3-20041.pdf)). (2) \"The rostrocaudal coordinate is given in parentheses after the corresponding physical coordinates, and the other two (dorsoventral and mediolateral) can be obtained with the transparent overlay provided in Appendix B.\" (quoted from chapter \u2018D. How to Use this Atlas\u2019 of the 3rd edition of Brain Maps, p. 15; ISBN: 0-126-10582-0). Based on Figure 4 from chapter [\u2018A. Histology and Map Production\u2019 of the 3rd edition of Brain Maps (pdf version from Swanson\u2019s homepage)](http://larrywswanson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-Atlas-prep-BrainMaps3-20041.pdf)), the coordinate system is oriented towards the right since the rat\u2019s right hemisphere has been used to draw the atlas. Thus, giving Swanson\u2019s coordinate system RIA orientation (X, Y, Z axes are oriented towards right, inferior and anterior, respectively). Note: More detailed descriptions were provided in the 3rd edition of the atlas (digital and book combined) compared to the 1st edition, but both describe the exact same coordinate system.",
